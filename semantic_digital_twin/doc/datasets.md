# Datasets

Semantic Digital Twin can load datasets from internet resources.
The results of the loaded datasets are completely function digital twins 
(World instances including Semantic Annotations, Kinematics, etc.).


## Sage
Scenes from [Sage](https://nvlabs.github.io/sage/) can be loaded with:

```python
from semantic_digital_twin.adapters.sage_10k_dataset.loader import Sage10kDatasetLoader

loader = Sage10kDatasetLoader()
scene = loader.create_scene(scene_url=Sage10kDatasetLoader.available_scenes()[0])
world = scene.create_world()
```

## Sapien / PartNet

Articulated assets from the [PartNet-Mobility](https://sapien.ucsd.edu/browse) dataset can be loaded with:

```python
from semantic_digital_twin.adapters.partnet_mobility_dataset.loader import PartNetMobilityDatasetLoader

loader = PartNetMobilityDatasetLoader()
world = loader.load(model_id=179) # model_id can be found at https://sapien.ucsd.edu/browse
```

Note that this requires the `sapien` library to be installed and the `SAPIEN_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable to be set.

## RoboCasa

Objects, fixtures, full kitchen scenes, and manipulation tasks from [RoboCasa](https://github.com/robocasa/robocasa) can be loaded with:

```python
from semantic_digital_twin.adapters.robocasa_dataset.loader import RoboCasaDatasetLoader
from semantic_digital_twin.adapters.robocasa_dataset.semantics import (
    RoboCasaKitchenApplianceCategory,
    RoboCasaObjectCategory,
)

loader = RoboCasaDatasetLoader()

kitchen_world = loader.load_kitchen(layout_id=..., style_id=...)  # a full kitchen scene
appliance_world = loader.load_kitchen_appliance(RoboCasaKitchenApplianceCategory.CABINET)  # a single appliance
object_world = loader.load_object(RoboCasaObjectCategory.APPLE)  # a single object
```

A RoboCasa task (for example `"TurnOnMicrowave"`) can be loaded together with the scene it is defined
over. `load_task` returns a `RoboCasaTask` binding the `World` to the task's natural-language
instruction, the bodies to be manipulated, and the pose the robot should start at. RoboCasa's own
robot is stripped from the world, since `semantic_digital_twin` owns the robot.

```python
task = loader.load_task("TurnOnMicrowave", layout_id=..., style_id=...)
task.instruction          # e.g. "Press the start button on the microwave."
task.manipulated_objects  # the bodies the task requires the robot to interact with
task.robot_base_pose      # where to spawn the semantic_digital_twin-owned robot
```

Note that this requires the `robocasa` and `robosuite` libraries to be installed (`robosuite` must be
installed from git, `pip install git+https://github.com/ARISE-Initiative/robosuite.git`), and the
fixture/object assets to be downloaded via `python -m robocasa.scripts.download_kitchen_assets`
(pointed at by `RoboCasaDatasetLoader.directory`, `~/robocasa-assets` by default).

## ArtVIP

Professionally modelled, articulated CAD furniture and appliances (including a dedicated IKEA furniture
category) from [ArtVIP](https://x-humanoid-artvip.github.io/) can be loaded with:

```python
from semantic_digital_twin.adapters.artvip_dataset.loader import ArtVipDatasetLoader
from semantic_digital_twin.adapters.artvip_dataset.schema import ArtVipCategory

loader = ArtVipDatasetLoader()
loader.available_objects(ArtVipCategory.IKEA_FURNITURE)  # every object name in a category

obj = loader.load(ArtVipCategory.IKEA_FURNITURE, "EKET_Cabinet_with_door_brown_walnut_effect_35x35x35cm")
obj.world  # one Body per rigid link
```

Objects are USD stages parsed by `semantic_digital_twin.adapters.usd.parser.USDParser` (the USD counterpart to
`URDFParser`/`MJCFParser`): `RevoluteConnection`/`PrismaticConnection` per USD Physics joint of the
matching type, `FixedConnection` otherwise. The catalog is 450 objects across the 9 `ArtVipCategory`
values; `available_objects` returns each object's path relative to its category, occasionally nested a
subcategory deeper (e.g. `major_appliances/refrigerator/fridge/fridge_01`).

`ArtVipDatasetLoader.load` always loads exactly one named object - the ArtVIP catalog itself is
structured as one USD file per object, not per scene. `USDParser` itself is not limited to that: a
stage with several unconnected top-level prims and no physics joints between them parses into one World
with a separate Body per prim, so a multi-object USD scene composed outside ArtVIP (e.g. authored by
hand or exported from a DCC tool) loads the same way, just without `ArtVipDatasetLoader`'s
category/name bookkeeping.

The dataset is public (Apache 2.0), no gated access. Requires the `usd-core` library (`pxr`).

## GraspClutter6D

Real, densely cluttered bin/shelf/table scenes from
[GraspClutter6D](https://sites.google.com/view/graspclutter6d) (1000 scenes, ~14
objects/scene, 200 object models plus the standard YCB-Video objects), annotated with
real per-frame camera parameters and 6D object ground-truth poses in the
[BOP dataset format](https://github.com/thodan/bop_toolkit):

```python
from semantic_digital_twin.adapters.grasp_clutter_6d_dataset.loader import (
    GraspClutter6DDatasetLoader,
    GraspClutter6DModelVariant,
    GraspClutter6DObjectSet,
    GraspClutter6DSplit,
)

loader = GraspClutter6DDatasetLoader()
scene_id = loader.available_scene_ids(
    object_set=GraspClutter6DObjectSet.GRASP, split=GraspClutter6DSplit.TRAIN
)[0]
models_directory = loader.download_models(GraspClutter6DModelVariant.EVAL)

# scene = loader.load_scene(scene_id)  # only after download_scenes() - see below
```

Unlike this package's other dataset loaders, GraspClutter6D does not store its scenes as
separate repository files - all 1000 are packed into one combined, 5-volume, ~203 GB
`scenes.7z` archive, so `GraspClutter6DDatasetLoader.load_scene` needs
`download_scenes()` to have downloaded and extracted the whole thing first; there is no
way to fetch a single scene. `download_split_info()` (scene id lists) and
`download_models()` (object meshes) are comparatively small and safe to call freely.

`GraspClutter6DScene.from_directory`/`load_scene` only parse a scene's ground truth
(`scene_camera.json`/`scene_gt.json`) - not its RGB/depth/mask images, and not a World.
Call `.create_world(image_id, models_directory)` on the parsed scene to build one for a
given frame, with one `Body` per object placed at its ground-truth pose relative to the
camera (and, with `with_world_frame=True`, a `map` root body placing the camera itself,
for frames that carry a world-to-camera transform).

Requires the `huggingface_hub` and `py7zr` packages.

## Reading a dataset from a server

The loaders above download a dataset and keep it locally, which stops working once a
corpus is measured in terabytes. Such a dataset can be served over http instead and read
an entry at a time, with a local cache holding only what has actually been used.

```python
from semantic_digital_twin.adapters.dataset_server import DatasetServer
from semantic_digital_twin.world_description.mesh_file_storage import MeshFileSources

MeshFileSources().use(DatasetServer.from_environment())
```

`DatasetServer.from_environment` reads the server's address from
`SEMANTIC_DIGITAL_TWIN_DATASET_SERVER`, the dataset's location on the machine serving it
from `SEMANTIC_DIGITAL_TWIN_DATASET_ROOT`, and where to keep its files from
`SEMANTIC_DIGITAL_TWIN_MESH_CACHE`, which defaults to the directory this package keeps
everything else it downloads in. A world loaded afterwards needs nothing further: a
mesh's files are fetched the first time something asks for its geometry, and never again.

For a description parsed from a file, pass the server as a path resolver instead, which
needs no registration:

```python
WorldSpecification.from_urdf(path, path_resolver=CompositePathResolver([server]))
```

Anything that serves a directory tree and answers a directory with a json listing can be
the server. nginx does both without code, through
[`autoindex`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_autoindex_module.html#autoindex) and
[`autoindex_format`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_autoindex_module.html#autoindex_format).
